# Comments and suggestions from the practical seminar to be considered for possible future works;

- Present statistical test significance value instead of conclusion;

- Be very careful when dealing with time - make sure the experiments are fair - maybe it's easier to not analyze;

- Be careful when using a flat classifier:
  - Evaluate the different classifiers based on non hieararquical methods;
  - Discuss more it's limitations (for example, a flat classifier does not work for a DAG since we do not have information on the path taken)
  - Be careful when using data taken from data streams - we might be breaking the "iid" assumption for example
  - Explain better the approach taken (classifier per father node)
  - Utilize a different dataset (for example, Victor had access to a good protein dataset...)
