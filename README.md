# hierarquical-panda
A repository for the 2019 Hierarchiical Classification seminar for the ICMC course "Advanced Topics in AI".

We analyzed the current theory and state of art in hierarchical classification and executed some sample experiments, both with local and global models for two datasets, instrument and insect classification.

# Topics

The main topics were taken from the book [`Inteligência Artificial - Uma Abordagem de Aprendizado de Máquina`](https://www.passeidireto.com/livro/inteligencia-artificial-uma-abordagem-de-aprendizado-de-maquina-9788521621461) by André carlos ponce de leon ferreira de Carvalho, Katti Faceli, Ana carolina Lorena and João Gama.
